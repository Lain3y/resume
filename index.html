    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Adaptable and motivated administrator with varied work experience looking to break into the world of tech. I am excited to leverage my passion for learning and emerging technical skills to complete a Code First Girls degree.  Currently I am completing a CFG Web Development kick starter but I would love to expand my skills further.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Property Administrator</h3>
    | Belong Ltd | 2020 - Present |</h3>
    <p>
        Working with an asset management system to ensure all aspects of 8 dementia care villages are maintained, from specialist care equipment to fire suppression systems. In this role I regularly practice logical thinking to problem solve issues for the villages, often working to tight deadlines to respond to emergency jobs and complete necessary health and safety paperwork. Team work and time management are crucial in this role as the work is reactive and time sensitive for the comfort and safety of residents and staff. I have trained new staff and created a guide for new starters with detailing the key processes within the department.   
    </p>
    <h3>Teacher Training</h3>
    | Cheshire East SCITT + Manchester Metropolitan University | 2019 - 2020 |</h3>
    <p>
        Doing a school centred teacher training programme meant that I was teaching from day one of the course. This enhanced my presentation and research skills as I worked to interpret the curriculum and design and deliver my own lessons and engage students. I also worked collaboratively with another trainee to plan and team teach a range of lessons. 
    </p>
    <h3>Programme Administrator</h3>
    | University of Chester | 2015 - 2019 |</h3>
    <p>
        This role helped to further my IT skills as I supported students and staff by creating programme documents and maintaining online work spaces for multiple modules. It also honed my communication and organisation skills through my day to day support, but particularly for interview and open days. I regularly had to co-ordinate staff and student volunteers to ensure staffing levels, appropriate catering and room setup across 4 campuses. 
    </p>
    <h3>Administration Analyst</h3>
    | Atos Origin | 2014 - 2015 |</h3>
    <p>
        I supported the change management and incident management teams at an IT solutions company. This role developed my IT skills as I learnt how to use internal databases and systems. It also furthered my interpersonal skills, as workflow coordinator for IM team I responded to the high volume of urgent incoming incidents, and liaised with IMs to fairly allocate the jobs. 

    </p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
   <h3>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
   <p>
    I have just completed a Code First Girl Web Development Kickstarter which included creating a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am now completing an online web dev bootcamp to further strengthen my skills and knowledge. 
   </p>
   <h3>Attention to detail</h3>
   <p>
    My current role requires me to carefully check and amend key documents. 
   </p>
   <h3>Planning, Teaching and empathy</h3>
   <p>
    Teacher training developed my ability to present information in a way that considered the specific learning and pastoral needs of all students I taught. In my current role I have supported and trained new staff. 
   </p>
   <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
   <p>
    My background in historical research has helped to strengthen my critical thinking skills.
